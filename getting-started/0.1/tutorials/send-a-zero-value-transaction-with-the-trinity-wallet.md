# Send your first message to the Tangle (Trinity)

**Trinity is a mobile and desktop application with a user interface that allows you to transfer data and IOTA tokens in an IOTA network. A zero-value transaction can be sent using a random seed that doesn't contain IOTA tokens. These transactions are useful for sending and storing immutable messages on the Tangle.**

Trinity allows you to do the following:

* Create a password-protected account to store and access your seeds
* Read your balance and transaction history
* Send and receive transactions
